# CDSL: Cryptography for Dynamic Systems Library


CDSL provides codes for implementing secure dynamic systems based on modern cryptography.
The library features linear dynamic controllers operating over homomorphically encrypted data implemented using [Lattigo](https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo) version 6.1.0.
The encrypted controllers are designed based on the state-of-the-art methods developed by CDSL, [SNU](https://post.cdsl.kr/) and [SEOULTECH](https://junsookim4.wordpress.com/).

### Features


This code provides two methods to operate the linear dynamic controller over encrypted data, using a Ring-LWE based cryptosystem. 


- `ctrRGSW` [1]: Supports unlimited number of recursive homomorhpic multiplications without the use of bootstrapping. More specifically, the encrypted controller state is recursively multiplied to the encrypted state matrix without decryption. The effect of error growth is suppressed by the stability of the closed-loop system. 
    - `ctrRGSW/noPacking`: Naive implementation that does not use packing. 
    - `ctrRGSW/packing`: A novel "coefficient packing" technique is applied, resulting in enhanced computation speed and memory efficiency   
    




- `ctrRLWE`: This implementation is based on the encrypted controller design proposed in Section IV of [2].
    The encrypted controller is non-recursive, although it is based on a dynamic controller.
    This is enabled by ``re-encryption'' of the encrypted controller output at the actuator, which requires an additional communication link between the plant and the controller.
    However, under sufficiently fast communication, the encrypted controller operates faster than that of `ctrRGSW`.
    The example code is based on the BGV scheme, but this can be easily modified to use other Ring-LWE based schemes.

- In this example, we use the four-tank system [7] as the plant and pre-design an observer-based controller. Please refer to [8] for more details regarding the setting.


- `integer_ctr` [9]: Provides algorithms for design of controllers having integer coefficients, a property that is required to implement linear dynamic controllers over encrypted data.
    - `stabilization`: Finds a stabilizing controller having integer coefficients for any given discrete-time LTI plant. (Section III of [9])
    - `conversion`: Converts a pre-designed controller into one having integer coefficients while preserving the original closed-loop transfer function. (Section IV of [9])
